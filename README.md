This project uses CNNs to analyze MRI and PET scans for early Alzheimer’s detection. It integrates multi-modal data, including genetic markers and cognitive assessments, enhancing diagnostic accuracy. With Explainable AI (XAI) and real-time patient monitoring via wearables, it offers reliable insights for Alzheimer’s research.
